FUNCTIONS
    SetErrorMode(mode, /)
        Wrapper around SetErrorMode.
    
    get_osfhandle(fd, /)
        Return the file handle for the file descriptor fd.
        
        Raises OSError if fd is not recognized.
    
    getch()
        Read a keypress and return the resulting character as a byte string.
        
        Nothing is echoed to the console. This call will block if a keypress is
        not already available, but will not wait for Enter to be pressed. If the
        pressed key was a special function key, this will return '\000' or
        '\xe0'; the next call will return the keycode. The Control-C keypress
        cannot be read with this function.
    
    getche()
        Similar to getch(), but the keypress will be echoed if possible.
    
    getwch()
        Wide char variant of getch(), returning a Unicode value.
    
    getwche()
        Wide char variant of getche(), returning a Unicode value.
    
    heapmin()
        Minimize the malloc() heap.
        
        Force the malloc() heap to clean itself up and return unused blocks
        to the operating system. On failure, this raises OSError.
    
    kbhit()
        Return true if a keypress is waiting to be read.
    
    locking(fd, mode, nbytes, /)
        Lock part of a file based on file descriptor fd from the C runtime.
        
        Raises OSError on failure. The locked region of the file extends from
        the current file position for nbytes bytes, and may continue beyond
        the end of the file. mode must be one of the LK_* constants listed
        below. Multiple regions in a file may be locked at the same time, but
        may not overlap. Adjacent regions are not merged; they must be unlocked
        individually.
    
    open_osfhandle(handle, flags, /)
        Create a C runtime file descriptor from the file handle handle.
        
        The flags parameter should be a bitwise OR of os.O_APPEND, os.O_RDONLY,
        and os.O_TEXT. The returned file descriptor may be used as a parameter
        to os.fdopen() to create a file object.
    
    putch(char, /)
        Print the byte string char to the console without buffering.
    
    putwch(unicode_char, /)
        Wide char variant of putch(), accepting a Unicode value.
    
    setmode(fd, mode, /)
        Set the line-end translation mode for the file descriptor fd.
        
        To set it to text mode, flags should be os.O_TEXT; for binary, it
        should be os.O_BINARY.
        
        Return value is the previous mode.
    
    ungetch(char, /)
        Opposite of getch.
        
        Cause the byte string char to be "pushed back" into the
        console buffer; it will be the next character read by
        getch() or getche().
    
    ungetwch(unicode_char, /)
        Wide char variant of ungetch(), accepting a Unicode value.
