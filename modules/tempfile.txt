Help on module tempfile:

NAME
    tempfile - Temporary files.

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides generic, low- and high-level interfaces for
    creating temporary files and directories.  All of the interfaces
    provided by this module can be used without fear of race conditions
    except for 'mktemp'.  'mktemp' is subject to race conditions and
    should not be used; it is provided for backward compatibility only.
    
    The default path names are returned as str.  If you supply bytes as
    input, all return values will be in bytes.  Ex:
    
        >>> tempfile.mkstemp()
        (4, '/tmp/tmptpu9nin8')
        >>> tempfile.mkdtemp(suffix=b'')
        b'/tmp/tmppbi8f0hy'
    
    This module also provides some data items to the user:
    
      TMP_MAX  - maximum number of names that will be tried before
                 giving up.
      tempdir  - If this is set to a string before the first use of
                 any routine from this module, it will be considered as
                 another candidate location to store temporary files.

     |  
     |  Create and return a temporary directory.  This has the same
     |  behavior as mkdtemp but can be used as a context manager.  For
     |  example:
     |  
     |      with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
     |          ...
     |  
     |  Upon exiting the context, the directory and everything contained
     |  in it are removed.

FUNCTIONS
    NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+b', buffering=-1, encoding=None, newline=None, suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None, delete=True)
        Create and return a temporary file.
        Arguments:
        'prefix', 'suffix', 'dir' -- as for mkstemp.
        'mode' -- the mode argument to io.open (default "w+b").
        'buffering' -- the buffer size argument to io.open (default -1).
        'encoding' -- the encoding argument to io.open (default None)
        'newline' -- the newline argument to io.open (default None)
        'delete' -- whether the file is deleted on close (default True).
        The file is created as mkstemp() would do it.
        
        Returns an object with a file-like interface; the name of the file
        is accessible as its 'name' attribute.  The file will be automatically
        deleted when it is closed unless the 'delete' argument is set to False.
    
    TemporaryFile = NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+b', buffering=-1, encoding=None, newline=None, suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None, delete=True)
        Create and return a temporary file.
        Arguments:
        'prefix', 'suffix', 'dir' -- as for mkstemp.
        'mode' -- the mode argument to io.open (default "w+b").
        'buffering' -- the buffer size argument to io.open (default -1).
        'encoding' -- the encoding argument to io.open (default None)
        'newline' -- the newline argument to io.open (default None)
        'delete' -- whether the file is deleted on close (default True).
        The file is created as mkstemp() would do it.
        
        Returns an object with a file-like interface; the name of the file
        is accessible as its 'name' attribute.  The file will be automatically
        deleted when it is closed unless the 'delete' argument is set to False.
    
    gettempdir()
        Accessor for tempfile.tempdir.
    
    gettempdirb()
        A bytes version of tempfile.gettempdir().
    
    gettempprefix()
        The default prefix for temporary directories.
    
    gettempprefixb()
        The default prefix for temporary directories as bytes.
    
    mkdtemp(suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None)
        User-callable function to create and return a unique temporary
        directory.  The return value is the pathname of the directory.
        
        Arguments are as for mkstemp, except that the 'text' argument is
        not accepted.
        
        The directory is readable, writable, and searchable only by the
        creating user.
        
        Caller is responsible for deleting the directory when done with it.
    
    mkstemp(suffix=None, prefix=None, dir=None, text=False)
        User-callable function to create and return a unique temporary
        file.  The return value is a pair (fd, name) where fd is the
        file descriptor returned by os.open, and name is the filename.
        
        If 'suffix' is not None, the file name will end with that suffix,
        otherwise there will be no suffix.
        
        If 'prefix' is not None, the file name will begin with that prefix,
        otherwise a default prefix is used.
        
        If 'dir' is not None, the file will be created in that directory,
        otherwise a default directory is used.
        
        If 'text' is specified and true, the file is opened in text
        mode.  Else (the default) the file is opened in binary mode.  On
        some operating systems, this makes no difference.
        
        If any of 'suffix', 'prefix' and 'dir' are not None, they must be the
        same type.  If they are bytes, the returned name will be bytes; str
        otherwise.
        
        The file is readable and writable only by the creating user ID.
        If the operating system uses permission bits to indicate whether a
        file is executable, the file is executable by no one. The file
        descriptor is not inherited by children of this process.
        
        Caller is responsible for deleting the file when done with it.
    
    mktemp(suffix='', prefix='tmp', dir=None)
        User-callable function to return a unique temporary file name.  The
        file is not created.
        
        Arguments are similar to mkstemp, except that the 'text' argument is
        not accepted, and suffix=None, prefix=None and bytes file names are not
        supported.
        
        THIS FUNCTION IS UNSAFE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED.  The file name may
        refer to a file that did not exist at some point, but by the time
        you get around to creating it, someone else may have beaten you to
        the punch.
