NAME
    runpy - runpy.py - locating and running Python code using the module namespace

DESCRIPTION
    Provides support for locating and running Python scripts using the Python
    module namespace instead of the native filesystem.
    
    This allows Python code to play nicely with non-filesystem based PEP 302
    importers when locating support scripts as well as when importing modules.

FUNCTIONS
    run_module(mod_name, init_globals=None, run_name=None, alter_sys=False)
        Execute a module's code without importing it
        
        Returns the resulting top level namespace dictionary
    
    run_path(path_name, init_globals=None, run_name=None)
        Execute code located at the specified filesystem location
        
        Returns the resulting top level namespace dictionary
        
        The file path may refer directly to a Python script (i.e.
        one that could be directly executed with execfile) or else
        it may refer to a zipfile or directory containing a top
        level __main__.py script.
