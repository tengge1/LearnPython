    cmath

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides access to mathematical functions for complex
    numbers.

FUNCTIONS
    acos(z, /)
        Return the arc cosine of z.
    
    acosh(z, /)
        Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of z.
    
    asin(z, /)
        Return the arc sine of z.
    
    asinh(z, /)
        Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of z.
    
    atan(z, /)
        Return the arc tangent of z.
    
    atanh(z, /)
        Return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of z.
    
    cos(z, /)
        Return the cosine of z.
    
    cosh(z, /)
        Return the hyperbolic cosine of z.
    
    exp(z, /)
        Return the exponential value e**z.
    
    isclose(a, b, *, rel_tol=1e-09, abs_tol=0.0)
        Determine whether two complex numbers are close in value.
        
          rel_tol
            maximum difference for being considered "close", relative to the
            magnitude of the input values
          abs_tol
            maximum difference for being considered "close", regardless of the
            magnitude of the input values
        
        Return True if a is close in value to b, and False otherwise.
        
        For the values to be considered close, the difference between them must be
        smaller than at least one of the tolerances.
        
        -inf, inf and NaN behave similarly to the IEEE 754 Standard. That is, NaN is
        not close to anything, even itself. inf and -inf are only close to themselves.
    
    isfinite(z, /)
        Return True if both the real and imaginary parts of z are finite, else False.
    
    isinf(z, /)
        Checks if the real or imaginary part of z is infinite.
    
    isnan(z, /)
        Checks if the real or imaginary part of z not a number (NaN).
    
    log(x, y_obj=None, /)
        The logarithm of z to the given base.
        
        If the base not specified, returns the natural logarithm (base e) of z.
    
    log10(z, /)
        Return the base-10 logarithm of z.
    
    phase(z, /)
        Return argument, also known as the phase angle, of a complex.
    
    polar(z, /)
        Convert a complex from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
        
        r is the distance from 0 and phi the phase angle.
    
    rect(r, phi, /)
        Convert from polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates.
    
    sin(z, /)
        Return the sine of z.
    
    sinh(z, /)
        Return the hyperbolic sine of z.
    
    sqrt(z, /)
        Return the square root of z.
    
    tan(z, /)
        Return the tangent of z.
    
    tanh(z, /)
        Return the hyperbolic tangent of z.
