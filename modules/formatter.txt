Help on module formatter:

NAME
    formatter - Generic output formatting.

DESCRIPTION
    Formatter objects transform an abstract flow of formatting events into
    specific output events on writer objects. Formatters manage several stack
    structures to allow various properties of a writer object to be changed and
    restored; writers need not be able to handle relative changes nor any sort
    of ``change back'' operation. Specific writer properties which may be
    controlled via formatter objects are horizontal alignment, font, and left
    margin indentations. A mechanism is provided which supports providing
    arbitrary, non-exclusive style settings to a writer as well. Additional
    interfaces facilitate formatting events which are not reversible, such as
    paragraph separation.
    
    Writer objects encapsulate device interfaces. Abstract devices, such as
    file formats, are supported as well as physical devices. The provided
    implementations all work with abstract devices. The interface makes
    available mechanisms for setting the properties which formatter objects
    manage and inserting data into the output.

    class AbstractFormatter(builtins.object)
     |  AbstractFormatter(writer)
     |  
     |  The standard formatter.
     |  
     |  This implementation has demonstrated wide applicability to many writers,
     |  and may be used directly in most circumstances.  It has been used to
     |  implement a full-featured World Wide Web browser.

    class AbstractWriter(NullWriter)
     |  A writer which can be used in debugging formatters, but not much else.
     |  
     |  Each method simply announces itself by printing its name and
     |  arguments on standard output.

    class DumbWriter(NullWriter)
     |  DumbWriter(file=None, maxcol=72)
     |  
     |  Simple writer class which writes output on the file object passed in
     |  as the file parameter or, if file is omitted, on standard output.  The
     |  output is simply word-wrapped to the number of columns specified by
     |  the maxcol parameter.  This class is suitable for reflowing a sequence
     |  of paragraphs.

     |  No methods of the writer are called by NullFormatter instances.
     |  
     |  Implementations should inherit from this class if implementing a writer
     |  interface but don't need to inherit any implementation.

     |  which do not need to inherit any implementation methods.
