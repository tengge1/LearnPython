Help on module pydoc:

NAME
    pydoc - Generate Python documentation in HTML or text for interactive use.

DESCRIPTION
    At the Python interactive prompt, calling help(thing) on a Python object
    documents the object, and calling help() starts up an interactive
    help session.
    
    Or, at the shell command line outside of Python:
    
    Run "pydoc <name>" to show documentation on something.  <name> may be
    the name of a function, module, package, or a dotted reference to a
    class or function within a module or module in a package.  If the
    argument contains a path segment delimiter (e.g. slash on Unix,
    backslash on Windows) it is treated as the path to a Python source file.
    
    Run "pydoc -k <keyword>" to search for a keyword in the synopsis lines
    of all available modules.
    
    Run "pydoc -n <hostname>" to start an HTTP server with the given
    hostname (default: localhost) on the local machine.
    
    Run "pydoc -p <port>" to start an HTTP server on the given port on the
    local machine.  Port number 0 can be used to get an arbitrary unused port.
    
    Run "pydoc -b" to start an HTTP server on an arbitrary unused port and
    open a Web browser to interactively browse documentation.  Combine with
    the -n and -p options to control the hostname and port used.
    
    Run "pydoc -w <name>" to write out the HTML documentation for a module
    to a file named "<name>.html".
    
    Module docs for core modules are assumed to be in
    
        https://docs.python.org/X.Y/library/
    
    This can be overridden by setting the PYTHONDOCS environment variable
    to a different URL or to a local directory containing the Library
    Reference Manual pages.
