Help on module glob:

NAME
    glob - Filename globbing utility.

FUNCTIONS
    escape(pathname)
        Escape all special characters.
    
    glob(pathname, *, recursive=False)
        Return a list of paths matching a pathname pattern.
        
        The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la
        fnmatch. However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a
        dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?'
        patterns.
        
        If recursive is true, the pattern '**' will match any files and
        zero or more directories and subdirectories.
    
    iglob(pathname, *, recursive=False)
        Return an iterator which yields the paths matching a pathname pattern.
        
        The pattern may contain simple shell-style wildcards a la
        fnmatch. However, unlike fnmatch, filenames starting with a
        dot are special cases that are not matched by '*' and '?'
        patterns.
