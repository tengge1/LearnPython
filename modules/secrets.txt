CLASSES
    random.Random(_random.Random)
        random.SystemRandom
    
    class SystemRandom(Random)
     |  SystemRandom(x=None)
     |  
     |  Alternate random number generator using sources provided
     |  by the operating system (such as /dev/urandom on Unix or
     |  CryptGenRandom on Windows).
     |  
     |   Not available on all systems (see os.urandom() for details).
     |  
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      SystemRandom
     |      Random
     |      _random.Random

     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  getrandbits(self, k)
     |      getrandbits(k) -> x.  Generates an int with k random bits.

     |  getstate = _notimplemented(self, *args, **kwds)
     |  
     |  random(self)

     |      Stub method.  Not used for a system random number generator.
     |  
     |  setstate = _notimplemented(self, *args, **kwds)

     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Methods inherited from Random:
     |  
     |  __getstate__(self)
     |      # Issue 17489: Since __reduce__ was defined to fix #759889 this is no
     |      # longer called; we leave it here because it has been here since random was
     |      # rewritten back in 2001 and why risk breaking something.
     |  
     |  __init__(self, x=None)
     |      Initialize an instance.
     |      
     |      Optional argument x controls seeding, as for Random.seed().
     |  
     |  __reduce__(self)
     |      Helper for pickle.
     |  
     |  __setstate__(self, state)
     |  
     |  betavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Beta distribution.
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      Returned values range between 0 and 1.
     |  
     |  choice(self, seq)
     |      Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
     |  
     |  choices(self, population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)
     |      Return a k sized list of population elements chosen with replacement.
     |      
     |      If the relative weights or cumulative weights are not specified,
     |      the selections are made with equal probability.
     |  
     |  expovariate(self, lambd)
     |      Exponential distribution.
     |      
     |      lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
     |      nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
     |      a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
     |      positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
     |      infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.
     |  
     |  gammavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Gamma distribution.  Not the gamma function!
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      
     |      The probability distribution function is:
     |      
     |                  x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
     |        pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
     |                    math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha
     |  
     |  gauss(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Gaussian distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
     |      slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.
     |      
     |      Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.
     |  
     |  lognormvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Log normal distribution.
     |      
     |      If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
     |      normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
     |      mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.
     |  
     |  normalvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Normal distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.
     |  
     |  paretovariate(self, alpha)
     |      Pareto distribution.  alpha is the shape parameter.
     |  
     |  randint(self, a, b)
     |      Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
     |  
     |  randrange(self, start, stop=None, step=1, _int=<class 'int'>)
     |      Choose a random item from range(start, stop[, step]).
     |      
     |      This fixes the problem with randint() which includes the
     |      endpoint; in Python this is usually not what you want.
     |  
     |  sample(self, population, k)
     |      Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence or set.
     |      
     |      Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
     |      leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
     |      in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
     |      samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
     |      into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).
     |      
     |      Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
     |      population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
     |      selection in the sample.
     |      
     |      To choose a sample in a range of integers, use range as an argument.
     |      This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a
     |      large population:   sample(range(10000000), 60)
     |  
     |  shuffle(self, x, random=None)
     |      Shuffle list x in place, and return None.
     |      
     |      Optional argument random is a 0-argument function returning a
     |      random float in [0.0, 1.0); if it is the default None, the
     |      standard random.random will be used.
     |  
     |  triangular(self, low=0.0, high=1.0, mode=None)
     |      Triangular distribution.
     |      
     |      Continuous distribution bounded by given lower and upper limits,
     |      and having a given mode value in-between.
     |      
     |      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution
     |  
     |  uniform(self, a, b)
     |      Get a random number in the range [a, b) or [a, b] depending on rounding.
     |  
     |  vonmisesvariate(self, mu, kappa)
     |      Circular data distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and
     |      kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or
     |      equal to zero.  If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces
     |      to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi.
     |  
     |  weibullvariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Weibull distribution.
     |      
     |      alpha is the scale parameter and beta is the shape parameter.

FUNCTIONS
    choice(seq) method of random.SystemRandom instance
        Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
    
    compare_digest = _compare_digest(a, b, /)
        Return 'a == b'.
        
        This function uses an approach designed to prevent
        timing analysis, making it appropriate for cryptography.
        
        a and b must both be of the same type: either str (ASCII only),
        or any bytes-like object.
        
        Note: If a and b are of different lengths, or if an error occurs,
        a timing attack could theoretically reveal information about the
        types and lengths of a and b--but not their values.
    
    randbelow(exclusive_upper_bound)
        Return a random int in the range [0, n).
    
    randbits = getrandbits(k) method of random.SystemRandom instance
        getrandbits(k) -> x.  Generates an int with k random bits.
    
    token_bytes(nbytes=None)
        Return a random byte string containing *nbytes* bytes.
        
        If *nbytes* is ``None`` or not supplied, a reasonable
        default is used.
        
        >>> token_bytes(16)  #doctest:+SKIP
        b'\xebr\x17D*t\xae\xd4\xe3S\xb6\xe2\xebP1\x8b'
    
    token_hex(nbytes=None)
        Return a random text string, in hexadecimal.
        
        The string has *nbytes* random bytes, each byte converted to two
        hex digits.  If *nbytes* is ``None`` or not supplied, a reasonable
        default is used.
        
        >>> token_hex(16)  #doctest:+SKIP
        'f9bf78b9a18ce6d46a0cd2b0b86df9da'
    
    token_urlsafe(nbytes=None)
        Return a random URL-safe text string, in Base64 encoding.
        
        The string has *nbytes* random bytes.  If *nbytes* is ``None``
        or not supplied, a reasonable default is used.
        
        >>> token_urlsafe(16)  #doctest:+SKIP
        'Drmhze6EPcv0fN_81Bj-nA'
