Help on module _osx_support:

NAME
    _osx_support - Shared OS X support functions.

FUNCTIONS
    compiler_fixup(compiler_so, cc_args)
        This function will strip '-isysroot PATH' and '-arch ARCH' from the
        compile flags if the user has specified one them in extra_compile_flags.
        
        This is needed because '-arch ARCH' adds another architecture to the
        build, without a way to remove an architecture. Furthermore GCC will
        barf if multiple '-isysroot' arguments are present.
    
    customize_compiler(_config_vars)
        Customize compiler path and configuration variables.
        
        This customization is performed when the first
        extension module build is requested
        in distutils.sysconfig.customize_compiler).
    
    customize_config_vars(_config_vars)
        Customize Python build configuration variables.
        
        Called internally from sysconfig with a mutable mapping
        containing name/value pairs parsed from the configured
        makefile used to build this interpreter.  Returns
        the mapping updated as needed to reflect the environment
        in which the interpreter is running; in the case of
        a Python from a binary installer, the installed
        environment may be very different from the build
        environment, i.e. different OS levels, different
        built tools, different available CPU architectures.
        
        This customization is performed whenever
        distutils.sysconfig.get_config_vars() is first
        called.  It may be used in environments where no
        compilers are present, i.e. when installing pure
        Python dists.  Customization of compiler paths
        and detection of unavailable archs is deferred
        until the first extension module build is
        requested (in distutils.sysconfig.customize_compiler).
        
        Currently called from distutils.sysconfig
    
    get_platform_osx(_config_vars, osname, release, machine)
        Filter values for get_platform()
