FUNCTIONS
    S_IFMT(...)
        Return the portion of the file's mode that describes the file type.
    
    S_IMODE(...)
        Return the portion of the file's mode that can be set by os.chmod().
    
    S_ISBLK(...)
        S_ISBLK(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from a block special device file.
    
    S_ISCHR(...)
        S_ISCHR(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from a character special device file.
    
    S_ISDIR(...)
        S_ISDIR(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from a directory.
    
    S_ISDOOR(...)
        S_ISDOOR(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from a door.
    
    S_ISFIFO(...)
        S_ISFIFO(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from a FIFO (named pipe).
    
    S_ISLNK(...)
        S_ISLNK(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from a symbolic link.
    
    S_ISPORT(...)
        S_ISPORT(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from an event port.
    
    S_ISREG(...)
        S_ISREG(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from a regular file.
    
    S_ISSOCK(...)
        S_ISSOCK(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from a socket.
    
    S_ISWHT(...)
        S_ISWHT(mode) -> bool
        
        Return True if mode is from a whiteout.
    
    filemode(...)
        Convert a file's mode to a string of the form '-rwxrwxrwx'
