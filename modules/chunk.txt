NAME
    chunk - Simple class to read IFF chunks.

DESCRIPTION
    An IFF chunk (used in formats such as AIFF, TIFF, RMFF (RealMedia File
    Format)) has the following structure:
    
    +----------------+
    | ID (4 bytes)   |
    +----------------+
    | size (4 bytes) |
    +----------------+
    | data           |
    | ...            |
    +----------------+
    
    The ID is a 4-byte string which identifies the type of chunk.
    
    The size field (a 32-bit value, encoded using big-endian byte order)
    gives the size of the whole chunk, including the 8-byte header.
    
    Usually an IFF-type file consists of one or more chunks.  The proposed
    usage of the Chunk class defined here is to instantiate an instance at
    the start of each chunk and read from the instance until it reaches
    the end, after which a new instance can be instantiated.  At the end
    of the file, creating a new instance will fail with an EOFError
    exception.
    
    Usage:
    while True:
        try:
            chunk = Chunk(file)
        except EOFError:
            break
        chunktype = chunk.getname()
        while True:
            data = chunk.read(nbytes)
            if not data:
                pass
            # do something with data
    
    The interface is file-like.  The implemented methods are:
    read, close, seek, tell, isatty.
    Extra methods are: skip() (called by close, skips to the end of the chunk),
    getname() (returns the name (ID) of the chunk)
    
    The __init__ method has one required argument, a file-like object
    (including a chunk instance), and one optional argument, a flag which
    specifies whether or not chunks are aligned on 2-byte boundaries.  The
    default is 1, i.e. aligned.

CLASSES

        Chunk
    
    class Chunk(builtins.object)
     |  Chunk(file, align=True, bigendian=True, inclheader=False)
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, file, align=True, bigendian=True, inclheader=False)
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |  
     |  close(self)
     |  
     |  getname(self)
     |      Return the name (ID) of the current chunk.
     |  
     |  getsize(self)
     |      Return the size of the current chunk.
     |  
     |  isatty(self)
     |  
     |  read(self, size=-1)
     |      Read at most size bytes from the chunk.
     |      If size is omitted or negative, read until the end
     |      of the chunk.
     |  
     |  seek(self, pos, whence=0)
     |      Seek to specified position into the chunk.
     |      Default position is 0 (start of chunk).
     |      If the file is not seekable, this will result in an error.
     |  
     |  skip(self)
     |      Skip the rest of the chunk.
     |      If you are not interested in the contents of the chunk,
     |      this method should be called so that the file points to
     |      the start of the next chunk.
     |  
     |  tell(self)
     |
