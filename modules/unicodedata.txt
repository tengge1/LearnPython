NAME
    unicodedata

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides access to the Unicode Character Database which
    defines character properties for all Unicode characters. The data in
    this database is based on the UnicodeData.txt file version
    11.0.0 which is publicly available from ftp://ftp.unicode.org/.
    
    The module uses the same names and symbols as defined by the
    UnicodeData File Format 11.0.0.

     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __getattribute__(self, name, /)
     |      Return getattr(self, name).
     |  
     |  bidirectional(self, chr, /)
     |      Returns the bidirectional class assigned to the character chr as string.
     |      
     |      If no such value is defined, an empty string is returned.
     |  
     |  category(self, chr, /)
     |      Returns the general category assigned to the character chr as string.
     |  
     |  combining(self, chr, /)
     |      Returns the canonical combining class assigned to the character chr as integer.
     |      
     |      Returns 0 if no combining class is defined.
     |  
     |  decimal(self, chr, default=None, /)
     |      Converts a Unicode character into its equivalent decimal value.
     |      
     |      Returns the decimal value assigned to the character chr as integer.
     |      If no such value is defined, default is returned, or, if not given,
     |      ValueError is raised.
     |  
     |  decomposition(self, chr, /)
     |      Returns the character decomposition mapping assigned to the character chr as string.
     |      
     |      An empty string is returned in case no such mapping is defined.
     |  
     |  digit(self, chr, default=None, /)
     |      Converts a Unicode character into its equivalent digit value.
     |      
     |      Returns the digit value assigned to the character chr as integer.
     |      If no such value is defined, default is returned, or, if not given,
     |      ValueError is raised.
     |  
     |  east_asian_width(self, chr, /)
     |      Returns the east asian width assigned to the character chr as string.
     |  
     |  lookup(self, name, /)
     |      Look up character by name.
     |      
     |      If a character with the given name is found, return the
     |      corresponding character.  If not found, KeyError is raised.
     |  
     |  mirrored(self, chr, /)
     |      Returns the mirrored property assigned to the character chr as integer.
     |      
     |      Returns 1 if the character has been identified as a "mirrored"
     |      character in bidirectional text, 0 otherwise.
     |  
     |  name(self, chr, default=None, /)
     |      Returns the name assigned to the character chr as a string.
     |      
     |      If no name is defined, default is returned, or, if not given,
     |      ValueError is raised.
     |  
     |  normalize(self, form, unistr, /)
     |      Return the normal form 'form' for the Unicode string unistr.
     |      
     |      Valid values for form are 'NFC', 'NFKC', 'NFD', and 'NFKD'.
     |  
     |  numeric(self, chr, default=None, /)
     |      Converts a Unicode character into its equivalent numeric value.
     |      
     |      Returns the numeric value assigned to the character chr as float.
     |      If no such value is defined, default is returned, or, if not given,
     |      ValueError is raised.
