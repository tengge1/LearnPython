Help on built-in module _tracemalloc:

NAME
    _tracemalloc - Debug module to trace memory blocks allocated by Python.

FUNCTIONS
    clear_traces()
        Clear traces of memory blocks allocated by Python.
    
    get_traceback_limit()
        Get the maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of a trace.
        
        By default, a trace of an allocated memory block only stores
        the most recent frame: the limit is 1.
    
    get_traced_memory()
        Get the current size and peak size of memory blocks traced by tracemalloc.
        
        Returns a tuple: (current: int, peak: int).
    
    get_tracemalloc_memory()
        Get the memory usage in bytes of the tracemalloc module.
        
        This memory is used internally to trace memory allocations.
    
    is_tracing()
        Return True if the tracemalloc module is tracing Python memory allocations.
    
    start(nframe=1, /)
        Start tracing Python memory allocations.
        
        Also set the maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of a
        trace to nframe.
    
    stop()
        Stop tracing Python memory allocations.
        
        Also clear traces of memory blocks allocated by Python.
