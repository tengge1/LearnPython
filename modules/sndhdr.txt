NAME
    sndhdr - Routines to help recognizing sound files.

DESCRIPTION
    Function whathdr() recognizes various types of sound file headers.
    It understands almost all headers that SOX can decode.
    
    The return tuple contains the following items, in this order:
    - file type (as SOX understands it)
    - sampling rate (0 if unknown or hard to decode)
    - number of channels (0 if unknown or hard to decode)
    - number of frames in the file (-1 if unknown or hard to decode)
    - number of bits/sample, or 'U' for U-LAW, or 'A' for A-LAW
    
    If the file doesn't have a recognizable type, it returns None.
    If the file can't be opened, OSError is raised.
    
    To compute the total time, divide the number of frames by the
    sampling rate (a frame contains a sample for each channel).
    
    Function what() calls whathdr().  (It used to also use some
    heuristics for raw data, but this doesn't work very well.)
    
    Finally, the function test() is a simple main program that calls
    what() for all files mentioned on the argument list.  For directory
    arguments it calls what() for all files in that directory.  Default
    argument is "." (testing all files in the current directory).  The
    option -r tells it to recurse down directories found inside
    explicitly given directories.

FUNCTIONS
    what(filename)
        Guess the type of a sound file.
    
    whathdr(filename)
        Recognize sound headers.
