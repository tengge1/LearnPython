Help on built-in module _functools:

NAME
    _functools - Tools that operate on functions.

FUNCTIONS
    cmp_to_key(...)
        Convert a cmp= function into a key= function.
    
    reduce(...)
        reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -> value
        
        Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence,
        from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.
        For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates
        ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5).  If initial is present, it is placed before the items
        of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the
        sequence is empty.
