Help on module select:

NAME
    select - This module supports asynchronous I/O on multiple file descriptors.

DESCRIPTION
    *** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
    On Windows, only sockets are supported; on Unix, all file descriptors.

FUNCTIONS
    select(...)
        select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout]) -> (rlist, wlist, xlist)
        
        Wait until one or more file descriptors are ready for some kind of I/O.
        The first three arguments are sequences of file descriptors to be waited for:
        rlist -- wait until ready for reading
        wlist -- wait until ready for writing
        xlist -- wait for an ``exceptional condition''
        If only one kind of condition is required, pass [] for the other lists.
        A file descriptor is either a socket or file object, or a small integer
        gotten from a fileno() method call on one of those.
        
        The optional 4th argument specifies a timeout in seconds; it may be
        a floating point number to specify fractions of seconds.  If it is absent
        or None, the call will never time out.
        
        The return value is a tuple of three lists corresponding to the first three
        arguments; each contains the subset of the corresponding file descriptors
        that are ready.
        
        *** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
        On Windows, only sockets are supported; on Unix, all file
        descriptors can be used.
