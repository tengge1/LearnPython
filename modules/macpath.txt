Help on module macpath:

NAME
    macpath - Pathname and path-related operations for the Macintosh.

FUNCTIONS
    abspath(path)
        Return an absolute path.
    
    basename(s)
    
    commonprefix(m)
        Given a list of pathnames, returns the longest common leading component
    
    dirname(s)
    
    exists(path)
        Test whether a path exists.  Returns False for broken symbolic links
    
    expanduser(path)
        Dummy to retain interface-compatibility with other operating systems.
    
    expandvars(path)
        Dummy to retain interface-compatibility with other operating systems.
    
    getatime(filename)
        Return the last access time of a file, reported by os.stat().
    
    getctime(filename)
        Return the metadata change time of a file, reported by os.stat().
    
    getmtime(filename)
        Return the last modification time of a file, reported by os.stat().
    
    getsize(filename)
        Return the size of a file, reported by os.stat().
    
    isabs(s)
        Return true if a path is absolute.
        On the Mac, relative paths begin with a colon,
        but as a special case, paths with no colons at all are also relative.
        Anything else is absolute (the string up to the first colon is the
        volume name).
    
    isdir(s)
        Return true if the pathname refers to an existing directory.
    
    isfile(path)
        Test whether a path is a regular file
    
    islink(s)
        Return true if the pathname refers to a symbolic link.
    
    join(s, *p)
    
    lexists(path)
        Test whether a path exists.  Returns True for broken symbolic links
    
    normcase(path)
    
    normpath(s)
        Normalize a pathname.  Will return the same result for
        equivalent paths.
    
    realpath(path)
        # realpath is a no-op on systems without islink support
    
    split(s)
        Split a pathname into two parts: the directory leading up to the final
        bit, and the basename (the filename, without colons, in that directory).
        The result (s, t) is such that join(s, t) yields the original argument.
    
    splitdrive(p)
        Split a pathname into a drive specification and the rest of the
        path.  Useful on DOS/Windows/NT; on the Mac, the drive is always
        empty (don't use the volume name -- it doesn't have the same
        syntactic and semantic oddities as DOS drive letters, such as there
        being a separate current directory per drive).
    
    splitext(p)
        Split the extension from a pathname.
        
        Extension is everything from the last dot to the end, ignoring
        leading dots.  Returns "(root, ext)"; ext may be empty.
